# Jikan

This package is a wrapper around [Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/) without the overhead of time zones and time, only raw dates are handled.

It also adds more parsing formats as well as a method to extract dates from strings.

```bash
npm install jikan
```

You can also use any other package manager like `pnpm` or `bun`.
